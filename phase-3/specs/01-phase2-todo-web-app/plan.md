# Implementation Plan: Phase-2 Todo Web Application

**Branch**: `01-phase2-todo-web-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-03 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/01-phase2-todo-web-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Transform the Phase I in-memory Python console Todo application into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage using Next.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), SQLModel (ORM), and Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (database). Implement user authentication with Better Auth and JWT tokens to ensure proper user data isolation. This full-stack web application must support all 5 Basic Level Todo features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) with proper security, responsive UI, and comprehensive testing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (backend), TypeScript 5.0+ (frontend), Next.js 16+ (framework)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (backend web framework), SQLModel (ORM), Neon PostgreSQL (database), Better Auth (authentication), Tailwind CSS (styling)
**Storage**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage
**Testing**: pytest (backend unit/integration), Jest/React Testing Library (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web application (deployed to Vercel frontend, self-hosted backend)
**Project Type**: web (determines source structure with separate frontend and backend)
**Performance Goals**: API responses under 500ms for 95% of requests, page load times under 2 seconds for 90% of visits
**Constraints**: User data isolation required (each user sees only their own tasks), JWT token validation on all endpoints, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Support at least 100 concurrent users with proper database optimization

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All code must be implemented based on the requirements defined in the specification file (specs/01-phase2-todo-web-app/spec.md). No code may be written without corresponding specification requirements.

2. **Full-Stack Separation**: Frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) must be properly separated with clear API contracts. No direct database access from the frontend is permitted. Backend API will handle all database operations.

3. **Test-First Development**: Unit tests must be written before implementation code. API endpoints must have integration tests. Frontend components must have appropriate test coverage before being considered complete.

4. **Security-First Authentication**: User authentication and authorization must be implemented using Better Auth with JWT tokens. All API endpoints must validate JWT tokens and enforce user data isolation.

5. **Database-Driven Architecture**: All data operations must go through the SQLModel ORM with Neon PostgreSQL as the primary database. Proper database schema design with appropriate indexes and constraints must be implemented.

6. **API-First Design**: REST API endpoints must follow consistent patterns with proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and response formats. API contracts must be clearly defined before implementation.

**Structure Decision**: The project will use a monorepo structure with separate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories to maintain clear separation of concerns between client and server code. This follows the constitution's requirement for full-stack separation while keeping both applications in the same repository for easier development and deployment coordination.

## Phase-2 Overview

### Objectives and Goals

- Transform the Phase I console application into a modern web application
- Implement multi-user support with proper authentication and data isolation
- Provide persistent storage using Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Create responsive UI with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Ensure security through Better Auth and JWT tokens

### Expected Outcomes

- Fully functional web-based Todo application
- Secure authentication with user data isolation
- Responsive UI that works on multiple device sizes
- Comprehensive API for task management
- Proper testing coverage for all features

### Scope: Inclusions and Exclusions

**Included**:

- All 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
- User authentication with Better Auth and JWT tokens
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL integration
- Responsive Next.js frontend
- RESTful API with FastAPI backend
- Proper error handling and validation

**Excluded**:

- Advanced features (recurring tasks, due dates, priorities, tags)
- AI chatbot functionality (Phase III requirement)
- Kubernetes deployment (Phase IV requirement)
- Event-driven architecture (Phase V requirement)

### Dependencies on Phase-1

- Understanding of core Todo functionality and business logic
- Basic requirements and user expectations established in Phase I

## Functional Plan

### Core Features and Functionalities

- **Add Task**: Users can create new tasks with title and optional description
- **View Task List**: Users can retrieve and display all their tasks with status indicators
- **Update Task**: Users can modify existing task details (title, description)
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from their list
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can toggle task completion status
- **User Authentication**: Signup, signin, and session management with Better Auth
- **User Data Isolation**: Each user only sees their own tasks

### Detailed User Flows and Step-by-Step Interactions

1. **New User Registration Flow**: Visit site → Click signup → Enter credentials → Receive verification → Login to dashboard
2. **Task Management Flow**: Login → View task list → Add new task → Update task → Mark complete → Delete task
3. **Authentication Flow**: Visit protected route → Redirect to login → Enter credentials → Access protected features

### User Roles, Permissions, and Access Control

- **Registered Users**: Full CRUD access to their own tasks, authenticated sessions
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Access to login/signup pages only, redirected from protected routes
- **No Administrative Roles**: All registered users have the same permissions

### Business Rules and Validation Logic

- Task titles must be 1-200 characters
- Task descriptions are optional, max 1000 characters
- All API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- Users can only modify their own tasks
- Invalid requests return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Edge Cases and Error Handling Scenarios

- Invalid JWT tokens return 401 Unauthorized
- Attempts to access other users' data return 403 Forbidden
- Missing required fields return 400 Bad Request
- Non-existent tasks return 404 Not Found
- Database connection failures return 500 Internal Server Error

## Technical Architecture Plan

### System Architecture Description

The application follows a client-server architecture with a Next.js frontend communicating with a FastAPI backend. The backend connects to Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for data persistence. Better Auth handles user authentication and generates JWT tokens for secure API communication.

### Frontend Responsibilities and Boundaries

- Database connection management

### API Design Standards and Contracts

- RESTful API design with consistent endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

- JWT token in Authorization header
- Input validation and sanitization

### Authentication and Authorization Plan

- Better Auth for user registration and login
- JWT tokens for session management
- Middleware for token validation

- Input sanitization and validation
- Proper session management
- Performance optimization for database queries
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## Testing and QA Plan

### Required Test Types: Unit, Integration, End-to-End

- **Unit Tests**: Individual API endpoints, business logic, database models, and frontend components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint integration, database integration, authentication flows
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows, authentication and task management workflows

### Test Coverage Targets

- Backend API: 80%+ line coverage
- Critical business logic: 90%+ coverage
- Database operations: 75%+ coverage
- Frontend components: 70%+ coverage
