# User Research Methods

## Overview

User research is the systematic study of target users and their requirements to add realistic contexts to design processes. This guide covers the most effective methods for understanding user needs, behaviors, and motivations.

## Research Method Categories

### 1. Generative Research
- **Purpose**: Understand user needs, behaviors, and contexts
- **Timing**: Early in the design process
- **Methods**: User interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies

### 2. Evaluative Research
- **Purpose**: Test and validate design decisions
- **Timing**: Throughout the design process
- **Methods**: Usability testing, A/B testing, eye tracking

### 3. Continuous Research
- **Purpose**: Monitor ongoing user experience
- **Timing**: Post-launch and continuously
- **Methods**: Analytics analysis, user feedback programs

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Research

### Qualitative Research
- **Purpose**: Understand "why" and "how"
- **Sample Size**: Small (5-20 participants)
- **Methods**: Interviews, usability testing, ethnographic studies
- **Output**: Insights, quotes, observations, patterns

### Quantitative Research
- **Purpose**: Understand "what" and "how much"
- **Sample Size**: Large (100s or 1000s of users)
- **Methods**: Surveys, analytics, A/B tests
- **Output**: Statistics, percentages, conversion rates

## Primary Research Methods

### User Interviews
**Purpose**: Deep understanding of user needs, goals, and motivations

**Best Practices**:
- Prepare open-ended questions
- Avoid leading questions
- Practice active listening
- Follow up with probing questions
- Take detailed notes or record (with permission)

**Sample Questions**:
- "Tell me about your typical day using [product/service]"
- "What challenges do you face when trying to accomplish [task]?"
- "How do you currently solve [problem]?"

**Timing**: 30-60 minutes per session

### Contextual Inquiry
**Purpose**: Observe users in their natural environment

**Best Practices**:
- Conduct in the user's actual work environment
- Observe users performing real tasks
- Ask questions during or after observations
- Document both explicit and implicit behaviors

**Benefits**:
- Reveals real behaviors vs. stated behaviors
- Identifies environmental factors affecting usage
- Uncovers workarounds and unmet needs

### Usability Testing
**Purpose**: Evaluate design effectiveness and identify usability issues

**Best Practices**:
- Test with realistic tasks and scenarios
- Avoid giving hints or solutions
- Use think-aloud protocol
- Test early and often
- Test 5 users at a time for optimal insights

**Key Metrics**:
- Task completion rate
- Time on task
- Error rate
- User satisfaction scores

### Surveys and Questionnaires
**Purpose**: Gather data from large numbers of users

**Best Practices**:
- Keep surveys short (5-10 minutes)
- Use clear, unbiased language
- Mix question types (multiple choice, rating scales, open-ended)
- Test survey design before deployment
- Offer incentives for completion

**Types of Questions**:
- Demographic questions
- Behavioral questions
- Attitudinal questions
- Open-ended feedback

## Secondary Research Methods

### Analytics Review
**Purpose**: Understand how users currently behave with existing products

**Key Metrics to Analyze**:
- Page views and flow patterns
- Conversion funnels
- Drop-off points
- Feature usage rates
- Error rates

**Tools**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Hotjar

### Competitive Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand market landscape and identify opportunities

**Focus Areas**:
- Feature comparison
- User experience patterns
- Design approaches
- Pricing strategies
- User reviews and feedback

## Creating User Personas

### Essential Persona Elements
- **Demographics**: Age, occupation, location, education
- **Goals**: What the user is trying to accomplish
- **Frustrations**: Pain points and challenges
- **Behaviors**: How they currently solve the problem
- **Technology Comfort**: Device usage, technical aptitude

### Persona Creation Process
1. **Gather Data**: Collect from interviews, surveys, analytics
2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for common characteristics and behaviors
3. **Create Personas**: Develop 3-5 primary personas
4. **Validate**: Test personas against real user data
5. **Refine**: Update personas as you learn more

### Effective Persona Guidelines
- Base personas on real data, not assumptions
- Give personas names and faces
- Include specific details that inform design decisions
- Limit to 3-5 primary personas
- Keep personas simple and actionable

## User Journey Mapping

### Purpose
- Visualize the user's complete experience
- Identify pain points and opportunities
- Align teams around user experience
- Guide design priorities

### Journey Map Components
- **Stages**: High-level phases of the experience
- **Actions**: What the user does at each stage
- **Emotions**: How the user feels
- **Pain Points**: Frustrations and obstacles
- **Opportunities**: Areas for improvement

### Journey Mapping Process
1. **Define Scope**: Choose specific user and scenario
2. **Identify Touchpoints**: All interactions with your product/service
3. **Map Emotions**: How the user feels at each touchpoint
4. **Identify Pain Points**: Where users struggle
5. **Find Opportunities**: How to address pain points

## Research Planning

### Research Questions
- **Primary Questions**: Core questions you need answered
- **Secondary Questions**: Supporting questions
- **Avoid**: Leading or biased questions
- **Ensure**: Questions align with project goals

### Participant Recruitment
- **Define Criteria**: Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Sample Size**: 5-10 for usability, 10-20 for interviews
- **Recruitment Channels**: User database, recruiting firms, social media
- **Screening**: Ensure participants match target audience

### Research Sessions
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes for interviews, 45-90 for usability
- **Timing**: Schedule with consideration for participant availability
- **Format**: In-person, remote, or hybrid options
- **Environment**: Comfortable, distraction-free space

## Research Documentation

### Session Notes
- **Real-time**: Take notes during sessions
